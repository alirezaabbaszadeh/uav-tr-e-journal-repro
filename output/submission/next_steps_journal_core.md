# Next Writing Steps (Actionable)

1. Move C1/C3/C4/C6 directly into Results as confirmed claims.
2. Keep C2 as stress-robustness evidence with explicit Family A/B comparison.
3. Report C5 as a limitation and motivate expanded-seed confirmation run.
4. Source tables from `outputs/paper_v2_core/*` and `outputs/paper_v2_core_B/*`.
5. Before submission, run full-seed replication and refresh `results_significance.csv`.
