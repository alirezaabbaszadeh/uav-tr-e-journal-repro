# Next Writing Steps (Actionable)

1. Move C1/C3/C4/C6 directly into Results as confirmed claims.
2. Keep C2 as a stress-robustness result with explicit Family A/B comparison table.
3. Mark C5 as limitation and include a short paragraph on statistical power.
4. Use `outputs/paper_v2_core/*` and `outputs/paper_v2_core_B/*` as table sources in manuscript.
5. For final submission-quality inference, rerun with larger seed set and re-check `results_significance.csv`.
