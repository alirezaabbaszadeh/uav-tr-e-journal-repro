Dear Editor,

Please consider our manuscript for Transportation Research Part E.

The submission reports campaign-locked, reproducible evidence from `journal_v3_full_20260219_000231` for reliability-aware multi-UAV pickup and delivery with communication-risk and soft time-window penalties. Claims follow a strict size-regime policy (`N<=10` exact with certificate, `N=20/40` bound-gap, `N=80` scalability-only).

All manuscript tables, claim mapping, and review bundles are generated directly from code and archived manifests/logs.

Sincerely,
Corresponding Author
