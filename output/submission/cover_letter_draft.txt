Dear Editor,

We submit our manuscript on reliability-aware multi-UAV pickup and delivery under time-window constraints for consideration in Transportation Research Part E.

The accompanying repository is structured for journal-grade reproducibility, including deterministic profiles, frozen benchmark instances, solver baselines, and automated anonymous/camera-ready package generation.

Scientific evidence follows size-specific claim regimes: exact results for N<=10, incumbent+bound+gap for N=20/40, and scalability-only reporting for N=80.

Sincerely,
