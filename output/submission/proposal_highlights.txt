Family-B soft windows cut OR-Tools on-time at N=20 from 63.75% to 28.75%.
OR-Tools stays feasible at N=40; PyVRP is infeasible at N=40.
At N=20, OR-Tools gap is 7.74-8.03% vs PyVRP 15.23-16.88%.
N=80 is reported as scalability-only, with no bound/gap claims.
Reproducibility audit passed 18/18 gates with frozen benchmarks.
