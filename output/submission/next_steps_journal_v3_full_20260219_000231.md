# Next Writing Steps (journal_v3_full_20260219_000231)

1. Anchor Results section on C1/C3/C4/C6 and keep C5 conservative.
2. Use C2 as stress-robustness result with direct A/B numerical deltas.
3. Build figures from campaign tables only (no ad hoc recomputation).
4. Keep all appendix reproducibility references campaign-locked to `journal_v3_full_20260219_000231`.
5. For transfer to another journal, reuse the same claim-evidence map and update only venue-specific template text.
