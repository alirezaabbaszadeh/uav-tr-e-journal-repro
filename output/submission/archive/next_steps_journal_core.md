3. Report C5 as a limitation and motivate any final expanded-seed confirmation run if required by editor.
4. Source tables from `/home/ali/code/UAV/uav_tr_e_project/outputs/campaigns/journal_v3_full_20260219_000231/paper_A/*` and `/home/ali/code/UAV/uav_tr_e_project/outputs/campaigns/journal_v3_full_20260219_000231/paper_B/*`.
5. Keep campaign ID `journal_v3_full_20260219_000231` in supplementary reproducibility section.
