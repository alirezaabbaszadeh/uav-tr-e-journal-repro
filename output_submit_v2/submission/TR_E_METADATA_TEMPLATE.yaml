title: Reliability-Aware Multi-UAV Routing under Communication Outage Risk and Soft Time Windows
running_title: Reliability-Aware Multi-UAV Routing
abstract: Urban UAV logistics must meet time-window service levels while maintaining reliable command-and-control connectivity. We study a reliability-aware multi-UAV routing problem in which arc-level communication outage risk, estimated from an air-to-ground channel model and base-station layouts, is integrated with an energy proxy and soft time windows via a calibrated objective. We evaluate a solver stack combining an OR-Tools heuristic for scalable planning, a HiGHS mixed-integer model for certificate-gated exact solutions and bounds, and a hard time-window baseline (PyVRP). All evidence is locked to an audited campaign (journal_v3_full_20260219_000231) with a conservative claim regime: exact with certificate for N<=10, bound-gap for N=20/40, and scalability-only reporting for N=80.
