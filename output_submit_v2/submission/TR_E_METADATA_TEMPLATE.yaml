title: Reliability-Aware Multi-UAV Pickup and Delivery under Communication Risk and Soft Time Windows
running_title: Reliability-Aware Multi-UAV Logistics
abstract: Urban UAV logistics must satisfy time-window service levels under communication uncertainty. We study a reliability-aware multi-UAV pickup-and-delivery problem with an arc-level outage-risk model and a calibrated objective combining an energy proxy, risk, and soft time-window tardiness. All evidence is locked to an audited campaign (journal_v3_full_20260219_000231) with conservative claim policy (exact with certificate for N<=10; bound-gap for N=20 and N=40; scalability-only for N=80).
