This manuscript reports a campaign-locked study for reliability-aware multi-UAV pickup and delivery under communication risk and soft time windows. Evidence is fixed to campaign \texttt{journal\_v3\_full\_20260219\_000231}, with conservative claim policy: exact-with-certificate for $N\leq10$, bound-gap for $N\in\{20,40\}$, and scalability-only for $N=80$.
