\label{sec:limitations}

This study has several limitations.

\paragraph{Energy model.}
We use a linear energy proxy proportional to flight distance. Real multirotor energy consumption depends on payload, speed, and aerodynamics \citep{dorling2017}. Extending the model to payload-dependent power curves is a natural next step.

\paragraph{Communication model.}
The outage-risk model is a simplified air-to-ground abstraction based on LoS probability and excess losses \citep{alhourani2014,zeng2016}. It does not capture interference, network load, handover dynamics, or temporal fading. Nevertheless, it produces a nontrivial risk signal (Table~\ref{tab:risk_signal}) and supports sensitivity analysis across $B$, $\Delta$, and $K$.

\paragraph{Routing abstraction.}
We assume straight-line travel between nodes and static base-station coordinates. Urban airspace restrictions, no-fly zones, and obstacle-aware 3D routing would further constrain feasible trajectories.

\paragraph{Inference policy.}
We intentionally adopt a conservative claim regime. In particular, $N=80$ is treated as scalability-only and we exclude bounds/gaps by policy to avoid overclaiming from limited evidence.
