We studied a reliability-aware multi-UAV pickup-and-delivery problem that internalizes communication outage risk and soft time-window tardiness in a unified objective. Using a locked, audited experimental protocol, we quantified how time-window stress degrades service KPIs, how soft time windows preserve feasibility at medium and large scales relative to hard-TW baselines, and how base-station density and penalty calibration shape energy--risk--service tradeoffs.

Beyond numerical performance, a core deliverable is end-to-end reproducibility aligned with modern computational research expectations \citep{peng2011,stodden2016}. All results are tied to a single immutable evidence campaign with manifests, frozen instances, generated tables/figures, and machine-checked claim guarding, enabling reviewers to trace each reported statement back to auditable artifacts.
