We studied reliability-aware multi-UAV routing under communication outage risk and soft time windows, motivated by service-level pressures in urban last-mile operations. Communication reliability was modeled as an arc-level outage probability derived from an air-to-ground link abstraction and base-station layouts, and integrated with an energy proxy and tardiness penalties in a calibratable objective.

Using a locked, audited evidence campaign, we showed how time-window stress degrades service KPIs for scalable planning and how soft time windows preserve feasibility at sizes where hard feasibility collapses. Bound-gap evidence for medium sizes and scalability-only reporting at $N=80$ were enforced via a conservative claim regime. Finally, robustness and sensitivity analyses highlighted managerial levers such as base-station density and penalty calibration that materially shift the risk--service tradeoff.

The accompanying release includes frozen instances, manifests, generated tables/figures, and reviewer bundles to support traceable, reproducible evaluation.
