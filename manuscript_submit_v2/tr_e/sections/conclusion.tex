We presented a reliability-aware multi-UAV pickup-and-delivery model that internalizes communication outage risk and soft time-window penalties in a unified objective. Using a campaign-locked, audited experimental protocol, we showed how time-window stress affects service quality, how soft time windows preserve feasibility at scale relative to hard-TW baselines, and how base-station density and penalty calibration shape energy--risk--service tradeoffs.

Beyond numerical performance, the key deliverable is a reviewer-ready reproducibility package: all results are tied to a single audited campaign (\code{\CampaignID}), with manifests, an evidence index, machine-checked claim guarding, and anonymous/camera-ready bundles.
