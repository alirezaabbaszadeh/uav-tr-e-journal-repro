Urban UAV logistics offers rapid last-mile service, but operations must satisfy time-window service-level agreements while maintaining reliable command-and-control connectivity. We study reliability-aware multi-UAV routing with mixed pickup and delivery demands. Each flight arc is assigned an outage probability derived from a standard air-to-ground pathloss abstraction and a base-station layout; route plans trade off an energy proxy, communication outage risk, and soft time-window tardiness.

We evaluate an evidence-locked solver stack: an OR-Tools heuristic for scalable planning, a HiGHS mixed-integer model for certificate-gated exactness and bounds, and a hard time-window baseline (PyVRP). On the audited benchmark suite, stressing time windows (Family B) reduces the OR-Tools on-time rate at $N=20$ from 46.3\% to 36.3\%\evid{C2_A_N20_on_time}\evid{C2_B_N20_on_time} and increases mean total tardiness from 77.3 to 94.6 minutes\evid{C2_A_N20_tardiness}\evid{C2_B_N20_tardiness}. At $N=40$, soft time windows preserve feasibility (feasible rate $\approx 0.97$) while the hard time-window baseline returns no feasible solutions\evid{C3_A_N40_feasible_rate_a_n40_ortools}\evid{C3_A_N40_feasible_rate_a_n40_pyvrp}. We further quantify how base-station density and penalty calibration shift the risk--service tradeoff, providing actionable levers beyond algorithm selection. All tables and figures are generated from a single immutable campaign with manifests, claim guarding, and audit checks, enabling reviewer-grade reproducibility.
