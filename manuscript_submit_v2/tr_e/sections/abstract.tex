Urban UAV logistics must meet service-level time windows while operating under communication uncertainty. We study a reliability-aware multi-UAV pickup-and-delivery problem in which arc costs jointly capture an energy proxy and an arc-level communication outage risk, while time-window violations are penalized via soft time windows.

We lock all evidence to an audited, reproducible campaign (\code{\CampaignID}) with a conservative claim regime: exact-with-certificate for $N\leq 10$, bound-gap reporting for $N\in\{20,40\}$, and scalability-only characterization for $N=80$.

Empirically, time-window stress (Family B) degrades service quality for the main heuristic at medium size: at $N=20$, OR-Tools on-time rate drops from 46.3\% (Family A) to 36.3\% (Family B)\evid{C2_A_N20_on_time}\evid{C2_B_N20_on_time}, while mean total tardiness increases from 77.3 to 94.6 minutes\evid{C2_A_N20_tardiness}\evid{C2_B_N20_tardiness}. At $N=40$, OR-Tools remains feasible in both families (feasible rate $\approx 0.97$) while the hard-TW baseline collapses (feasible rate $0$)\evid{C3_A_N40_feasible_rate_a_n40_ortools}\evid{C3_B_N40_feasible_rate_b_n40_ortools}\evid{C3_A_N40_feasible_rate_a_n40_pyvrp}\evid{C3_B_N40_feasible_rate_b_n40_pyvrp}. In the bound-gap regime at $N=20$, OR-Tools yields a tighter mean gap than PyVRP in both families\evid{C4_A_N20_gap_pct_a_n20_ortools}\evid{C4_B_N20_gap_pct_b_n20_ortools}\evid{C4_A_N20_gap_pct_a_n20_pyvrp}\evid{C4_B_N20_gap_pct_b_n20_pyvrp}.

Finally, we provide managerial sensitivity analysis that links base-station density and time-window tightness to risk and service tradeoffs, and we release a complete reviewer-ready package (campaign manifests, evidence index, figures/tables, and anonymous/camera-ready bundles).
