\label{sec:methods}

We adopt a solver stack designed to (i) provide high-quality feasible solutions under tight runtime budgets, (ii) provide certificate-gated exactness and bounds on small/medium instances, and (iii) remain fully reproducible.

\subsection{Main heuristic: OR-Tools with soft time windows}
Our main engine is Google OR-Tools' vehicle routing solver \citep{ortools}. We build a multi-vehicle routing model with time dimensions for service timing and a load dimension for capacity propagation. Hard operational constraints (e.g., route continuity and capacity propagation) are enforced structurally, while time-window violations are handled via a soft penalty.

\paragraph{Soft time windows as a linear tardiness penalty.}
For each customer, service start times may exceed the latest time $b_i$, incurring a linear tardiness cost. This implementation matches the soft-TW term $\gamma\sum z_{ik}$ in \Cref{eq:obj}. The penalty weight is controlled by $\lambda_{TW}$ and is varied in robustness experiments to expose the energy--service tradeoff.

\subsection{Exact/bound engine: HiGHS MIP with certificate gating}
To support reviewer-safe inference, we solve the MIP formulation with HiGHS \citep{highs} for small/medium sizes under explicit time limits. We label a run \emph{exact} only when HiGHS returns an optimality certificate; otherwise, the incumbent is treated as a heuristic solution and bounds/gaps are reported only when the dual bound is finite and compatible with the incumbent objective.

\subsection{Baseline: PyVRP (hard time windows)}
We include PyVRP as a baseline metaheuristic solver \citep{pyvrp}. In our protocol, PyVRP retains hard time windows to represent a contrasting operational policy: strict compliance when feasible. Importantly, infeasibility under hard time windows is itself operationally meaningful. When time windows are tight or instances scale up, hard feasibility can collapse, motivating soft-TW policies that remain feasible while exposing the cost of lateness.

\subsection{Claim-safe reporting by size}
All reporting follows the conservative policy in Section~\ref{sec:formulation}: exact-with-certificate for $N\le 10$, bound-gap evidence for $N\in\{20,40\}$, and scalability-only characterization for $N=80$. This policy is enforced automatically in the pipeline and verified by the audit gate.
